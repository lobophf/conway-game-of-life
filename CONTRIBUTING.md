## What should I know before I get started?
Conway's Game Of Life is a Java implementation that uses the Swing as a Graphical User Interface. This open-source project writes dead or live pixels on the screen, and after each grid update, its stages change, following some rules.

To commits messages, it would be nice if you used the template available in this repository. You can easily configure it using the command below:
```
$ git config --local commit.template .git-commit-template.txt
```
So, when you create a commit, don't use the "-m" or "--message" option. Just type the command below and wait for your editor to open. The template file contains other instructions. When you finished, save and close the file.
